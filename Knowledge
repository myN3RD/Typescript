Typescript = Javascript + A type system




            THE TYPESCRIPT TYPE SYSTEM
        
_____________________________________________

Helps us catch errors during development -> Is a Helper to catch Errors

Only active during development

Doesnt provide any performance optimazation

Uses 'type annotations' to analyse our code

            ENVIRONMENT SETUP
        
_____________________________________________

sudo npm install -g typescript ts-node

tsc --help    -> for checking that its working

npm init -> we have to create a package.json file before we install axios!

npm install axios    (we use this to make a netword request) -> check if there is a axios folder now in the node modules folder!



            COMPILE
        
_____________________________________________

in terminal:

we have to go to the folder where the file sits which we want to compile


command:
tsc filename
tsc index.ts -> in the file explorer of VSCode is now a new ..js file -> thats the compiled version of out ts code

NOW 
in terminal:
node index.js

INSTEAD 2 commands -> we can use what we have installed before -> sudo npm install -g typescript ts-node

command:
ts-node filename -> this will safe us to make node index.ts AND node index.js -> so just one command instead of two
ts-node index.ts



           REAL TYPESCRIPT
_____________________________________________

interface -> "used to define the structure of an object"

its for telling ts the properties we are using (we dont have to use ALL properties! Just the ones we want)



           TYPESCRIPT SYSTEM

        there a two main field of knowledge in ts
            


Syntax + Features       vs          Design Patterns with TS

           TS TYPES                                          
 _____________________________________________
  
 every value is ts has a type!
 
 
 in TS a number is a number
 
 
 
 
        ->    Primitive types -> number, boolean, void, undefined, string, symbol, null
 
TYPES 
 
        ->    Object Types -> functions, arrays, classes, objects
