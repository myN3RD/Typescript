Typescript = Javascript + A type system




            THE TYPESCRIPT TYPE SYSTEM
        
_____________________________________________

Helps us catch errors during development -> Is a Helper to catch Errors

Only active during development

Doesnt provide any performance optimazation

Uses 'type annotations' to analyse our code




    Typescript Code (Javascript with annotations)

            ENVIRONMENT SETUP
        
_____________________________________________

sudo npm install -g typescript ts-node

tsc --help    -> for checking that its working

npm init -> we have to create a package.json file before we install axios!

npm install axios    (we use this to make a netword request) -> check if there is a axios folder now in the node modules folder!



            COMPILE
        
_____________________________________________

in terminal:

we have to go to the folder where the file sits which we want to compile


command:
tsc filename
tsc index.ts -> in the file explorer of VSCode is now a new ..js file -> thats the compiled version of out ts code

NOW 
in terminal:
node index.js

INSTEAD 2 commands -> we can use what we have installed before -> sudo npm install -g typescript ts-node

command:
ts-node filename -> this will safe us to make node index.ts AND node index.js -> so just one command instead of two
ts-node index.ts



           REAL TYPESCRIPT
_____________________________________________

interface -> "used to define the structure of an object"

its for telling ts the properties we are using (we dont have to use ALL properties! Just the ones we want)



           TYPESCRIPT SYSTEM
_____________________________________________


        there a two main field of knowledge in ts
            


Syntax + Features       vs          Design Patterns with TS

           TS TYPES                                          
 _____________________________________________
  
 every value is ts has a type!
 
 
 in TS a number is a number
 
 
 
 
        ->    Primitive types -> number, boolean, void, undefined, string, symbol, null
 
TYPES 
 
        ->    Object Types -> functions, arrays, classes, objects
        
        
        
           TYPE ANNOTATION                                          
 _____________________________________________
  we tell ts the type
  
  
  with Variables
  
            const apples: number = 5;
            let speed: string = 'fast';
            let hasName: boolean = true;

            let nothingMuch: null = null;
            let nothing: undefined = undefined;

            // build in objects
            let now: Date = new Date();
            
  
  with functions
  
                              This is the annutation, /a discription of the actuall function  /  AFTER  void start the actuall function
            const logNumber: (i: number) => void = (i: number) => {
              console.log(i);
            }
  
  
  
  with objects
  
            // Array
            let colors: string[] = ['red', 'green', 'blue'];
            let myNumbers: number[] = [1,2,3];
            let truths: boolean[] = [true, true, false, true, false];

            // Classes
            class Car {

            }
            let car: Car = new Car();
            
            
            
// When to use annotaions
// 1. Function that returns the 'any' type
const json = '{"x:": 10, "y": 20}';
const coordinates = JSON.parse(json);
console.log(coordinates); // console now {x: 10, y: 20};

# if we are using JSON.parse() -> ts actually has no clue what types we are using -> so in this case of using JSON.parse(), every type will be type 'any'!
AVOID variables with 'any' at all costs!!! otherwise ts cant rly work and err checking!

  
  
  
             TYPE INFERENCE                                          
 _____________________________________________
  ts guesses the type
