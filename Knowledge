Doesnt provide any performance optimazation

Uses 'type annotations' to analyse our code

            ENVIRONMENT SETUP
        
_____________________________________________

sudo npm install -g typescript ts-node

tsc --help    -> for checking that its working

npm init -> we have to create a package.json file before we install axios!

npm install axios    (we use this to make a netword request) -> check if there is a axios folder now in the node modules folder!



            COMPILE
        
_____________________________________________

in terminal:

we have to go to the folder where the file sits which we want to compile


command:
tsc filename
tsc index.ts -> in the file explorer of VSCode is now a new ..js file -> thats the compiled version of out ts code

NOW 
in terminal:
node index.js

INSTEAD 2 commands -> we can use what we have installed before -> sudo npm install -g typescript ts-node

command:
ts -node filename -> this will safe us to make node index.ts AND node index.js -> so just one command instead of two
